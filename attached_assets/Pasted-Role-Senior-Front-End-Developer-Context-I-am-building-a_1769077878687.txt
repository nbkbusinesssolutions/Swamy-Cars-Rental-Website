Role: Senior Front-End Developer Context: I am building a car rental website for "Swamy Cars Rental" in Madgaon, Goa. Task: Build a high-performance, animated Hero Section using the project's tech stack (Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion, and TypeScript).

1. Content Strategy (The Text): Implement a rotating typing animation for the main <h1> headline. Use these three catchy, benefit-driven phrases:

"Well-maintained self-drive cars right here in Madgaon."

"Explore Goa on your terms. Start your journey in minutes."

"Your perfect ride awaits. Trusted by 500+ locals."

2. Animation Sequence (Framer Motion Logic): Create a professional entry sequence using staggerChildren and variants:

The Trust Badge: (Top) Fade in and slide down slightly at 0.2s.

The Headline: (Middle) Typing animation begins at 0.4s. Ensure smooth transitions between phrases (fade out current, type in next).

The Subheading: "WhatsApp us, pick up near KTC Bus Stand, and start exploring Goa in minutes." — Fade in and slide up after the first headline finishes typing.

The CTAs: (Buttons) Staggered fade-in (0.2s apart) once the subheading is visible.

Primary: Green "Book on WhatsApp" (with a pulse or hover-glow effect).

Secondary: Glassmorphism/Outlined "View Our Fleet".

3. Technical Specs:

Styling: Use Tailwind CSS v4. Use @theme variables for brand colors. Ensure the background image has a dark overlay (gradient to black) to make the white/orange text pop.

Fonts: Use Space Grotesk for the headlines and Inter for the body text.

Responsiveness: Optimize for mobile first. On small screens, ensure the text doesn't overlap and the typing effect is centered.

Code Quality: Use TypeScript (.tsx). Create a reusable TypingText component for the headline.

What This Optimization Does for You
Uses Your Specific Tech: By mentioning Framer Motion and Tailwind v4, Replit will write modern code that doesn't rely on old CSS hacks.

Handles the "Typing" Problem: Instead of just "text," it asks for a TypingText component. This makes the code modular and easier to fix if you want to change the words later.

Visual Polish: It specifically asks for Glassmorphism and Staggered Animations, which are the secrets to making a website look "expensive" and professional.
